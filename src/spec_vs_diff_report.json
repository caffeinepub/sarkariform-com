  "summary": "Diff adds a Motoko backend content model + admin-guarded CRUD endpoints (partially visible due to truncation) and a new React/TanStack Router frontend with public pages (Home/Category/Detail/Search), admin pages, query-param-based filtering/sorting, and basic SEO title/description handling. Some requested items are not evidenced (pagination/infinite load, created timestamp display, favicon configuration). Also introduces unrequested user-profile onboarding modal and related backend profile APIs.",
